ETL Sample: Analyzing the Relationship Between Gun Violence and School Ratings in Chicago

This repository showcases a sample ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project designed to demonstrate data analytics proficiency.

üîç Open in Google Colab to explore interactive visualizations, including maps rendered from the data.
Project Overview

Inspired by an assignment from ISTA, this analysis integrates two datasets from the City of Chicago: one detailing school names, locations, and ratings, and the other tracking gun violence incidents in the area. The primary objective of this analysis is to investigate the correlation between gun violence incidents and school proficiency and safety ratings.
Project Components

    ETL Process: The project follows a structured ETL workflow:
        Extraction: Data is sourced from official Chicago government databases.
        Transformation: The extracted data is cleaned and standardized to create a coherent and accessible dataset.
        Loading: The transformed data is then loaded into an AWS pipeline, facilitating further queries and analysis.

Key Features

    Data Integration: Combines multiple data sources for comprehensive analysis.
    Interactive Visualizations: Utilize Google Colab to interactively explore and visualize data relationships.
    AWS Pipeline: Leverages cloud technology for scalable data management and analysis.

This project not only highlights technical skills in data manipulation and analysis but also emphasizes the importance of data-driven insights in understanding community issues.
